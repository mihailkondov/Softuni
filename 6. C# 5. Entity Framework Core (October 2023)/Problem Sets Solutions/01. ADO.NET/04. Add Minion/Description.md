This program executes SQL commands using the ADO.NET framework to write minion's name, age, town and employer. 

Town and employers (villains) are written is separate tables, so inserting a minion from a new town that's not in the database 
or a minion that works for a villain who is not in the database will create new entries in the towns or villains tables.
