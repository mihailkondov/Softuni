Note: Some comments use tabs to create ascii tables and schemas, but github converts my 4 space tabs to 8 space tabs. Sadly GitHub doesn't offer repository level setting for this. To fix the distortions you can either add ?ts=4 to the end of the url on github or set your default repository tab render to 4 spaces from Settings > Appearance > Tab size preference (I don't recommend it).
